    <p>Something cool about things that happen is that they happen all the time.
      Once I went to see something happen in person, and I saw something.
      I saw something dark and evil. 
      <br>
      It approached me from afar, and after a moment it briefly looked upon my visage and shuddered.
      It knew that I was going to be the one to fail, the one to die.
      <br>
      And now here I am.
